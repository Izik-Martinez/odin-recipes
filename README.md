I learned the importance of adding a period (dot) before the forward slash when linking to a file within other directories. For ex)  ./recipes/PotatoCakes.html
The "." means 'relative to this location'

I'm getting a lot of practice with git by completing this recipe project. The basic git commands are already becoming engrained in my memory.

I'm also getting lots of practice in the terminal: changing directories, creating files, renaming, etc.

This has been a fun practice exercise in basic HTML, git, and github.
